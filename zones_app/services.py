Location: {address}{zone_context}{places_context}

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. First, assess the security risk level of this location based on:
   - Type of facility (government buildings, banks, schools = higher risk)
   - Sensitivity of operations
   - Public accessibility
   - Nearby sensitive facilities
   - Potential threats

2. Based on your risk assessment, provide recommendations:
   - HIGH RISK facilities (courthouse, bank, government, military): Provide 6-8 recommendations
   - MEDIUM RISK facilities (school, hospital, commercial): Provide 4-5 recommendations  
   - LOW RISK facilities (residential, general area): Provide 2-3 recommendations

3. Each recommendation must be:
   - A single, clear, actionable statement
   - Specific to the facility type
   - Formatted as a plain text string

Focus areas to consider:
- Physical security measures
- Surveillance and monitoring
- Access control
- Perimeter security
- Emergency response
- Risk mitigation specific to nearby facilities

Return ONLY a JSON array of recommendation strings, nothing else. Format: ["recommendation 1", "recommendation 2", ...]"""
